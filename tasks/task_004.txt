# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Emulator Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop functionality to spawn, manage, and control Android emulators via ADB.
# Details:
1. Create a Rust module for emulator management
2. Implement functions to start/stop emulators using std::process::Command
3. Create API endpoints to manage emulator instances
4. Set up port mapping for multiple emulator instances
5. Implement emulator status tracking
6. Create functions to install apps on emulators
7. Develop error handling for emulator operations
8. Store emulator configurations in SQLite database

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests with mock emulator processes. Test starting/stopping multiple emulator instances. Verify port assignments work correctly. Test error handling when emulators fail to start.
