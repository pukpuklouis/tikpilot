# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Playwright Microservice
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a Node.js microservice using Playwright for browser automation and control.
# Details:
1. Set up a Node.js Express project for the Playwright service
2. Install and configure Playwright with Chromium support
3. Create API endpoints for common actions (scroll, like, comment)
4. Implement connection to emulator WebViews
5. Add browser fingerprinting randomization
6. Create Docker configuration for the service
7. Implement error handling and logging
8. Add health check endpoint

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for Playwright actions. Test connecting to mock WebView endpoints. Verify scrolling, clicking, and other interactions work correctly. Test error scenarios like connection failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Node.js/Express service with Playwright integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a Node.js project with Express framework and integrate Playwright with Chromium support
### Details:
1. Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init`
2. Install Express.js: `npm install express cors body-parser`
3. Install Playwright: `npm install playwright`
4. Configure Playwright with Chromium browser support
5. Create basic server structure with app.js and server.js files
6. Set up basic middleware (CORS, body-parser, etc.)
7. Implement a simple root endpoint to verify service is running
8. Create a Playwright browser instance management utility
9. Testing approach: Create unit tests to verify server initialization and Playwright browser launch

## 2. Implement core browser automation API endpoints [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create REST API endpoints for common browser automation actions like navigation, scrolling, clicking, and form interactions
### Details:
1. Design RESTful API structure for browser actions
2. Implement navigation endpoint (`/navigate`) to load URLs
3. Create interaction endpoints for:
   - Scrolling (`/scroll`)
   - Clicking (`/click`)
   - Form input (`/input`)
   - Like/reaction actions (`/like`)
   - Comment submission (`/comment`)
4. Add request validation middleware
5. Implement session management to handle multiple browser instances
6. Create controller functions that use Playwright API to execute requested actions
7. Add proper error handling for each endpoint
8. Testing approach: Write integration tests for each endpoint using supertest, verifying Playwright actions are correctly executed

## 3. Add WebView connection and browser fingerprinting [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement functionality to connect to emulator WebViews and add browser fingerprinting randomization
### Details:
1. Research and implement WebView connection methods for common emulators
2. Create a WebView connection utility that detects and connects to available WebViews
3. Add an API endpoint to list available WebViews
4. Implement an endpoint to connect to a specific WebView
5. Research browser fingerprinting techniques
6. Create a fingerprint randomization utility that can modify:
   - User-Agent strings
   - Canvas fingerprints
   - WebRTC fingerprints
   - Font fingerprints
7. Add configuration options for fingerprint randomization levels
8. Implement an endpoint to set fingerprinting options
9. Testing approach: Create tests that verify WebView connections and validate fingerprint randomization is working

## 4. Implement service containerization and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create Docker configuration, implement logging, error handling, and health monitoring endpoints
### Details:
1. Create a Dockerfile optimized for Playwright with necessary dependencies
2. Configure Docker environment variables for service configuration
3. Implement structured logging using a library like Winston or Pino
4. Add request/response logging middleware
5. Implement comprehensive error handling across the service
6. Create a `/health` endpoint that checks:
   - Server status
   - Playwright browser availability
   - Memory usage
   - Connection capabilities
7. Add a `/metrics` endpoint for monitoring service performance
8. Create docker-compose.yml for local development
9. Document deployment instructions
10. Testing approach: Verify Docker build process, test health endpoints, and validate logging works correctly in containerized environment
