# Description: Develop a Node.js microservice using Playwright for browser automation and control.
# Details:
1. Set up a Node.js Express project for the Playwright service
2. Install and configure Playwright with Chromium support
3. Create API endpoints for common actions (scroll, like, comment)
4. Implement connection to emulator WebViews
5. Add browser fingerprinting randomization
6. Create Docker configuration for the service
7. Implement error handling and logging
8. Add health check endpoint

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for Playwright actions. Test connecting to mock WebView endpoints. Verify scrolling, clicking, and other interactions work correctly. Test error scenarios like connection failures.
