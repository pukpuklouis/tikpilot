# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Backend with Playwright Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the Rust backend with the Playwright microservice for controlling emulators.
# Details:
1. Implement HTTP client in Rust to communicate with Playwright service
2. Create proxy endpoints in Rust for Playwright actions
3. Develop error handling for Playwright service communication
4. Implement retry logic for failed actions
5. Add request queuing for high-volume scenarios
6. Create WebSocket connection for real-time updates
7. Implement service discovery for multiple Playwright instances
8. Add metrics collection for action performance

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests between Rust and Playwright service. Test proxy endpoints with mock responses. Verify error handling and retry logic works correctly. Test WebSocket communication for real-time updates.
