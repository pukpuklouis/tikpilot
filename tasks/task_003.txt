# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Docker configuration for the Rust backend [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a multi-stage Dockerfile for the Rust backend that optimizes container size while ensuring proper build and runtime environments.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a Dockerfile in the backend directory
2. Set up a multi-stage build with:
   - First stage: Use rust:slim as build image
   - Install build dependencies and compile the application
   - Second stage: Use debian:slim-bookworm as runtime image
   - Copy only the compiled binary and necessary runtime files
3. Configure proper WORKDIR, USER (non-root), and ENTRYPOINT
4. Add health check using HEALTHCHECK instruction that tests the application's /health endpoint
5. Optimize the image by:
   - Using .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
   - Minimizing layers with combined RUN commands
   - Setting appropriate environment variables

Testing approach:
1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t backend:latest ./backend`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 backend:latest`
3. Verify the application starts correctly
4. Test the health check: `docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container_id>`
5. Check image size: `docker images backend:latest`

## 2. Create Docker configuration for the Remix frontend [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a Dockerfile for the Remix frontend that handles both build and runtime environments efficiently.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a Dockerfile in the frontend directory
2. Set up a multi-stage build with:
   - First stage: Use node:18-alpine as build image
   - Install dependencies with npm/yarn and build the Remix application
   - Second stage: Use node:18-alpine as runtime image
   - Copy built assets and necessary runtime files
3. Configure proper WORKDIR, USER (non-root), and CMD
4. Add health check using HEALTHCHECK instruction that tests the application's base URL
5. Optimize the image by:
   - Using .dockerignore to exclude node_modules, .git, etc.
   - Caching node_modules for faster builds
   - Setting NODE_ENV=production for runtime

Testing approach:
1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t frontend:latest ./frontend`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 frontend:latest`
3. Verify the application starts and is accessible at http://localhost:3000
4. Test the health check: `docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container_id>`
5. Check image size: `docker images frontend:latest`

## 3. Set up Docker Compose for local development environment [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create a Docker Compose configuration that orchestrates the backend and frontend containers with proper networking, volume mounting, and environment variables for development.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the project root
2. Define services for:
   - Backend service using the Dockerfile from subtask 1
   - Frontend service using the Dockerfile from subtask 2
   - Any additional services needed (database, cache, etc.)
3. Configure networking:
   - Create a custom network for inter-service communication
   - Map appropriate ports to host machine
   - Set service names for DNS resolution
4. Set up volume mounts for development:
   - Mount backend source code directory to enable hot-reloading
   - Mount frontend source code directory for live development
   - Use named volumes for persistent data (if applicable)
5. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a .env file for shared variables
   - Set service-specific environment variables in the compose file
   - Include development-specific settings
6. Add depends_on directives to establish proper startup order
7. Include healthcheck configurations to ensure services are ready

Testing approach:
1. Start the environment: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Verify all services start correctly: `docker-compose ps`
3. Test backend API access from frontend container
4. Make a code change in both frontend and backend to verify hot-reloading
5. Test environment variables are correctly passed to containers
6. Validate network connectivity between services
7. Shut down and restart to verify persistence: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

## 4. Create Dockerfiles for Backend and Frontend [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create optimized Dockerfiles for both the Rust backend (using multi-stage builds) and the Remix frontend applications.
### Details:
## Backend Dockerfile Implementation
1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the backend directory with multi-stage build:
   - Use `rust:slim` as the build image
   - Install necessary build dependencies
   - Copy source files and build with `cargo build --release`
   - Use a minimal runtime image like `debian:slim`
   - Copy only the compiled binary and necessary runtime files
   - Set proper permissions and non-root user
   - Configure health check with appropriate endpoint

## Frontend Dockerfile Implementation
1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the frontend directory:
   - Use `node:lts-alpine` as the base image
   - Copy package files and install dependencies
   - Copy source code and build the application
   - Set up the production runtime with minimal dependencies
   - Configure appropriate entry point

## Testing Approach
- Verify each Dockerfile builds successfully
- Check image sizes are optimized
- Validate containers start properly
- Test health check functionality for backend
- Ensure proper permissions are set

Note: Both Dockerfiles should follow best practices for security and optimization.

## 5. Configure Docker Compose for Local Development [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Create Docker Compose configuration for local development environment with proper networking, volume mounting, and environment variables.
### Details:
## Implementation Steps
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root with:
   - Service definitions for backend and frontend
   - Development-optimized configurations
   - Volume mounts for hot-reloading:
     - Mount backend source to `/app/src`
     - Mount frontend source to `/app/src`
   - Configure proper networking between services
   - Set up named volumes for persistent data if needed

2. Create a `.env` file template with all required environment variables:
   - Database connection strings
   - API endpoints and keys
   - Development-specific settings

3. Configure proper port mapping for local access:
   - Map backend API port (e.g., 8080:8080)
   - Map frontend port (e.g., 3000:3000)

## OrbStack-specific Instructions
1. Add comments in the docker-compose.yml for OrbStack users:
   ```yaml
   # For OrbStack users: This configuration works with OrbStack out of the box
   # You can access services using the .orb domain, e.g., frontend.orb
   ```
2. Document how to start with OrbStack:
   ```
   # Start with OrbStack
   open -a OrbStack
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Testing Approach
- Verify all services start correctly with `docker-compose up`
- Test code hot-reloading by making changes to source files
- Verify services can communicate with each other
- Confirm environment variables are properly passed to containers

## 6. Optimize Docker Configuration and Add Health Checks [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Enhance Docker configuration with health checks, optimize container sizes, and prepare for both development and production environments.
### Details:
## Implementation Steps
1. Add health checks to docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
     interval: 30s
     timeout: 10s
     retries: 3
     start_period: 40s
   ```

2. Create production-ready docker-compose file:
   - Create `docker-compose.prod.yml` with production optimizations
   - Remove development-specific volume mounts
   - Configure for production environment variables
   - Add resource constraints for containers
   - Set restart policies to `unless-stopped`

3. Optimize container configurations:
   - Add `.dockerignore` files to exclude unnecessary files
   - Configure proper caching for build layers
   - Minimize number of layers in Dockerfiles
   - Use multi-stage builds for both backend and frontend
   - Remove development dependencies in production builds

4. Document deployment process:
   - Create a README.md section for Docker deployment
   - Include instructions for both development and production
   - Document environment variable requirements
   - Add OrbStack-specific notes for local development only

## Testing Approach
- Verify health checks work by intentionally breaking services
- Measure and compare container sizes before and after optimization
- Test deployment using production configuration
- Verify resource constraints are properly applied
- Test container recovery with restart policies
