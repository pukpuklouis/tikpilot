# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Remix Frontend with TailwindCSS
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the web interface using Remix framework with TailwindCSS and shadcn components.
# Details:
1. Initialize a new Remix project
2. Configure TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components
3. Create layout components (header, sidebar, main content area)
4. Set up routing for main application pages
5. Create placeholder pages for Dashboard, Emulator Setup, and Action Control
6. Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing
7. Set up basic state management with Zustand
8. Configure API client for communicating with the backend

# Test Strategy:
Use Vitest for component testing. Verify responsive layouts work properly across different screen sizes. Test navigation between routes and initial loading states.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Remix Project with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundation of the application by initializing a Remix project and configuring TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new Remix project using `npx create-remix@latest`
2. Install TailwindCSS dependencies: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
3. Initialize TailwindCSS: `npx tailwindcss init -p`
4. Configure TailwindCSS by updating the tailwind.config.js file to include paths to template files
5. Add TailwindCSS directives to your CSS file
6. Set up shadcn/ui by following their Remix integration guide
7. Install and configure necessary shadcn components (button, card, dialog, etc.)
8. Create a basic theme configuration
9. Test the setup by creating a simple page with TailwindCSS styles and shadcn components

Testing approach:
- Verify that the Remix application builds without errors
- Confirm TailwindCSS classes are properly applied
- Ensure shadcn components render correctly with proper styling

## 2. Create Layout Structure and Application Routing [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the core layout components and establish the routing structure for the application.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create layout components:
   - Header component with application title and navigation
   - Sidebar component for main navigation links
   - Main content area with proper padding and responsive behavior
   - Footer component if needed
2. Set up responsive design using TailwindCSS breakpoints
3. Implement mobile-friendly navigation (collapsible sidebar)
4. Configure route structure in Remix:
   - Set up root layout in app/root.tsx
   - Create route files for Dashboard, Emulator Setup, and Action Control
   - Implement nested routing where appropriate
5. Create placeholder pages with basic content for each route
6. Add navigation between pages using Remix Link component

Testing approach:
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Verify that navigation works correctly between all pages
- Ensure layout components adapt properly on mobile devices
- Check that the route structure matches the application requirements

## 3. Implement State Management and API Client [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Set up Zustand for state management and configure an API client for backend communication.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Install Zustand: `npm install zustand`
2. Create store modules for different state concerns:
   - Create a main application store for global state
   - Set up specific stores for features (e.g., emulator settings, action controls)
3. Implement basic state management patterns with Zustand:
   - Define state properties and update functions
   - Create selectors for accessing state
4. Set up API client:
   - Install Axios or similar: `npm install axios`
   - Create an API client module with base configuration
   - Implement API endpoints as functions
   - Add request/response interceptors for error handling
5. Connect state management with API calls
6. Add loading states and error handling
7. Create utility hooks for common data fetching patterns

Testing approach:
- Test state management by creating simple UI controls that modify state
- Mock API responses to test client functionality
- Verify that state updates correctly when API calls succeed or fail
- Test error handling and loading states
