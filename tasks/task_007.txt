# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop AI Behavior Simulation Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core AI logic to mimic human-like interaction patterns across TikTok/Instagram.
# Details:
1. Implement randomized timing for actions
2. Create probability-based decision making for interactions
3. Develop natural scrolling patterns with variable speeds
4. Implement session duration variability
5. Create engagement probability models
6. Add randomized comment generation
7. Implement viewing time distributions for content
8. Create detection avoidance techniques

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for randomization functions. Create simulation tests to verify behavior patterns. Test timing distributions for actions. Verify comment generation produces realistic results.
