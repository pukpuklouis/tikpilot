      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up Rust Backend with Actix Web",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Rust backend setup with Actix Web into implementation phases focusing on: 1) Project initialization and dependencies, 2) Server structure and API endpoints, 3) Middleware and error handling, 4) Database connectivity and configuration management",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a complete backend framework with multiple components. While Actix Web simplifies some aspects, the task still requires configuring multiple systems including logging, error handling, database connections, and project structure. The complexity comes from integrating these components cohesively rather than the individual steps."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Remix Frontend with TailwindCSS",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Remix frontend implementation into logical phases: 1) Project setup with TailwindCSS and shadcn, 2) Layout and component structure, 3) Routing and page implementation, 4) State management and API integration",
      "reasoning": "Frontend development with Remix requires understanding its unique approach to routing and data loading. Integrating TailwindCSS and shadcn components adds moderate complexity. Creating responsive layouts and state management with Zustand further increases the complexity, though the individual tasks are well-defined."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Containerize Application with Docker",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the containerization process into: 1) Backend Dockerfile creation with multi-stage builds, 2) Frontend Dockerfile creation and optimization, 3) Docker Compose configuration with networking, volumes, and environment setup",
      "reasoning": "Containerization requires understanding Docker concepts and creating appropriate configurations for multiple services. The multi-stage builds add some complexity, but the task is relatively straightforward with clear steps. The main challenges are in configuring proper networking between containers and optimizing the builds."

    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Emulator Management System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the emulator management system into: 1) Core emulator control functions, 2) API endpoint development, 3) Port management and multi-instance handling, 4) Application installation functionality, 5) Persistence and configuration management",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex system interactions with Android emulators using ADB. Managing multiple emulator instances, handling port mappings, and ensuring reliable process control adds significant complexity. Error handling is particularly challenging as emulator operations can fail in various ways that need to be properly managed."

      "taskTitle": "Create Playwright Microservice",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Playwright microservice implementation into: 1) Node.js/Express service setup with Playwright, 2) Core browser automation API endpoints, 3) WebView connection and fingerprinting functionality, 4) Service containerization and health monitoring",
      "reasoning": "Building a browser automation microservice with Playwright involves complex asynchronous operations and careful error handling. Connecting to emulator WebViews adds technical complexity, while fingerprinting randomization requires specialized knowledge. The service needs to be robust as it's a critical component of the system."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Account Management System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the account management system into: 1) Database schema design and implementation, 2) CRUD operations and API endpoints, 3) Secure credential storage and encryption, 4) Account-emulator mapping and rotation strategies",
      "reasoning": "This task combines database design, secure credential handling, and complex business logic for account management. The encryption requirements add security considerations, while the account rotation strategies involve algorithmic complexity. The integration with emulators adds another layer of complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Develop AI Behavior Simulation Module",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI behavior simulation module into: 1) Randomization engine for timing and actions, 2) Probability models for engagement, 3) Natural scrolling and viewing patterns, 4) Content interaction decision algorithms, 5) Detection avoidance implementation",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves sophisticated algorithms to mimic human behavior. Creating convincing randomization that still follows human-like patterns requires statistical modeling. The detection avoidance techniques add significant complexity, requiring an understanding of how platforms detect automation."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Backend with Playwright Service",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the backend-Playwright integration into: 1) HTTP client implementation in Rust, 2) Proxy endpoints and error handling, 3) Request queuing and retry logic, 4) WebSocket implementation and service discovery",
      "reasoning": "This integration task involves creating robust communication between services with proper error handling and retry logic. The addition of WebSockets for real-time updates and service discovery for multiple instances adds complexity. The queuing system for high-volume scenarios requires careful design to prevent overloading."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Production Deployment Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the production deployment configuration into: 1) Production Docker setup with resource management, 2) Monitoring and logging infrastructure, 3) Security hardening and backup strategies, 4) Deployment documentation and optional Kubernetes configuration",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a production-ready deployment involves multiple considerations around security, monitoring, and reliability. Configuring Prometheus and Grafana adds complexity, as does implementing proper security hardening. The optional Kubernetes configuration would add significant additional complexity if implemented."

      "taskTitle": "Restructure Repository as Proper Monorepo",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the monorepo restructuring into: 1) Workspace configuration and directory structure setup, 2) Dependency management and build configuration, 3) Git configuration, hooks, and documentation updates",
      "reasoning": "Restructuring to a monorepo is primarily an organizational task with moderate complexity. The challenge lies in properly configuring workspaces, managing dependencies between packages, and ensuring the build process works correctly. Setting up git hooks to prevent nested repositories adds some technical complexity."
